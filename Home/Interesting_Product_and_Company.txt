an award-winning technology innovator using eye tracking to revolutionize patient care and vision performance, announced today it will be debuting its new RightEye EyeQ system tonight at CES Unveiled Las Vegas at 5:00 p.m. at the Mandalay Bay Shorelines Exhibit Hall in Las Vegas, Nevada. EyeQ gives people a closer look at their health using quick, computer game-style vision tests on an eye-tracking computer.

RightEye has been recognized as an Honoree in the CES 2018 Innovation Awards “Tech For A Better World” category for the life-changing benefits EyeQ provides by delivering earlier assessments of **autism, concussions, Parkinson’s disease, reading challenges** and more. RightEye will be demonstrating EyeQ during CES 2018, Jan. 9-12, in Booth 43037, Health and Wellness Marketplace, Sands Halls A-D.
